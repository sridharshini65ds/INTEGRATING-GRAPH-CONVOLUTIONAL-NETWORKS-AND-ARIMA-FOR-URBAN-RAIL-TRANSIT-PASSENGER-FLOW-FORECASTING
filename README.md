GCN-ARIMA HYBRID MODEL

This code integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) to leverage the strengths of both spatial and temporal modeling techniques. 
The GCN component effectively captures spatial dependencies by processing the graph structure of the rail network, while the ARIMA component models the temporal aspects of passenger flow data. 
By sequentially combining these models, the hybrid approach aims to provide a comprehensive solution to the complex spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in urban rail systems.
